ortiz = Player.create(name: "Daniel Ortiz", school: "Calvary", year: "Senior", scout: "UPDATE: With Ortiz transferring to Calvary to play under coach Victor Morris for his senior season, look for his game to open up even more.
Morris has a knack for getting outstanding production from his best players, building teams around perennial talents each year like last season with D’Marcus Hall.
Ortiz will have plenty of shooters around him, a high-quality big like Labree Williams and experienced basketball junkies like Ben Ponder. Anything less than a state title and MOP for Ortiz will be a letdown. He has the chance to get some real D-1 offers.
SCOUT: Plays like a pro. The comparison mostly comes from how he keeps the ball high on his jumper, much like Leonard, and tough to defend or for defenders to get a good contest on his jumper.
Excellent at reacting to defense, especially defenders who reach. Has a quick go-to behind the back dribble for anyone reaching.
Sweet stroke, a little flat on his free throws but still can hit all types of deep shots. Strange how his FTs seem to have much less arch than his long shots, though that may just have been in the time I saw him.
Great ball handling. Nice size and build. Finishes well with left hand, especially in traffic. Off the catch, he likes to do a quick size up and blow by his defender by attacking closeouts to the left and pull up or get to the basket. Pretty good off the dribble 15-ft. pull-up game. Also excels going left into a step-back three or long-two.
Quick, but doesn’t seem extraordinarily fast. Uses body, positioning and really good footwork to blow by opponents. Has a very good feel for his own rhythm as a player. Knows when to speed up, slow down, uses great footwork to get down the floor quickly.
I love his long jump-stops and euro-steps. The ball is attached to his hand so firmly, he must dribble all the time outside the gym or have huge hands.
Excellent ball-handling, especially when working for a shot. Next-level step-back game, doesn’t struggle to shoot on step-back threes. Great form.
Sometimes wants to take a dribble into his shot when he’s wide open, that tells me he’s a little more comfortable shooting off the dribble.
Decent knack for getting other players to right spots. Good vision, but not known as a passer.
Plays hard on defense. Good team defender.
I’d like to see him more in pick-and roll, but Southwood has a pretty methodical offense.
It’s hard to speed him up, and he doesn’t force the issue much in the games I’ve seen. He seems to fit more as a two, but he has been the offensive initiator in most games I’ve seen.")
